        hospitals in relation to permanent placement and locum opportunities in
        Australia (together, Pelacements). The Platform enables Hospitals to
        list available locum opportunities, for Doctors to express an interest

        hire and recruitment services via the Platform in relation to

        (Third Party Services). To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall
        have no Liability for any Third Party Services, or any unavailability of

        accurate and complete description of the Locum Opportunity (including

        any other details the Doctor has submitted to us via the Platform.
        <br /><br />(d) A Hospital may, in its sole discretion, choose from any
        Doctor who has submitted an Application.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />(e) If a Hospital accepts an Application via the Platform,
        the Locum Opportunity will be identified as an Engagement and an
        Engagement Agreement will form between us and the Doctor based on the
        Listing pursuant to which the Doctor will be engaged by us to fill the
        Locum Opportunity for the Hospital. <br /><br />(f) Upon an Engagement
        being formed and prior to the Doctor performing the services set out in
        the Listing under an Engagement, the Hospital must provide to the Doctor
        via the Platform any documents relevant to the Engagement (including
        hospital policies and procedures) (Background Documents).<br /><br />(g)

        users of the Platform. <br /><br />(h) We accept no Liability for any
        aspect of the interaction between Hospitals and &nbsp; Doctors,
